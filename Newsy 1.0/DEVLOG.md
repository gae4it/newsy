This document tracks the development process of the Newsy web application.

## 2025-09-03

### Project Initialization
- Initialized a new React + TypeScript project using Vite.
- Installed Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer, and Cheerio for HTML parsing.
- Manually created Tailwind and PostCSS configuration files due to initialization issues.
- Updated `index.css` to include Tailwind directives.

### Core Structure
- Created main components: `App.tsx`, `NewsFetcher.tsx`, and `NewsList.tsx`.
- Added a `utils` folder with `newsUtils.ts` for fetching, parsing, deduplicating, and summarizing news.
- Added a `services` folder with `corsProxy.ts` to handle CORS issues using multiple proxy services.

### UI/UX
- Implemented a simple, centered UI with two main buttons (Italy, Germany), a loading spinner, and error handling.
- Used Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean design.

### Functionality
- Fetches news from 68k.news for Italy and Germany using a CORS proxy.
- Extracts up to 30 news items, deduplicates by title, and generates a mock summary in Italian.
- Displays news with title and summary, updates on each button click (stateless behavior).

### Troubleshooting
- Addressed Tailwind/PostCSS plugin issues by installing `@tailwindcss/postcss` and updating configuration.
- Added fallback and instructions for CORS errors in development.
